 		<h1>Ty'Arrah Walker</h1> 
 		<h2>Sophomore/Supply Chain Management</h2>
 			<p>My name is Ty'Arrah Walker, a Sophomre Supply Chain Management major from Little Rock, AR. I come from a large family, with two younger sisters and one older brother. I have a younger cousin who is like a brother to me. I have two dogs, and I hate cats. I am a lover of all things beauty and fashion. 
 			<br><br>I am an entrepreneur and I have a online marketplace by the name of CLIQUE. The reason that I am taking this class is to learn how to design a online marketplace in the similiar capacity of Etsy. It has really been hard to find a consistent coder to work with, so I have decided to take matters into my own hands and learn how to do it in myself. I find this stuff very hard and intimidating at times, seeing that I am surrounded by Information Systems majors who have back ground knowledge of this stuff, and I am clueless. I expect to learn a lot from this class, and although I expect to walk away with an "A," the most important thing to me is actually learning how coding works. </p>
